Create two combo boxes to allow a user to select between three different musical
instruments and the required musical level on the form. Also, add two buttons, one for
submitting the instrument selection and another to display an average musical level
report. Once the user has selected a musical instrument and musical level, display the
lesson cost for that particular instrument. Use the following table for the musical
instruments and lesson levels:
Guitar Piano Violin
Beginner 150 250 280
Intermediate 215 232 280
Advanced 130 185 310

You must also create a menu system that will allow the user to exit the application under
the file menu. Then, under the Tools menu, allow the form submission and display the
average level lesson cost. The layout of the form is left to your discretion. Marks will be
